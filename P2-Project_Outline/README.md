## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an Dialysis Patient Treatment tracker that will allow users to track patients 
and their treatments by patient name, treatment days and treatment date. 
Users will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit, remove and compare patients 
treatments. They will be able to review all of the patient's treatment information by week, month
quarter or year.

I decided to make this project because I am a Dialysis RN. We always need the most up to date 
treatment information on our patients. Most of the time we would receive this information from
the Nurse who previously treated the patient, but at times that Nurse would not be available. 

This application can be beneficial for users who want a quick synapse of their patient treatment
histories. Which can help them formulate a better Plan of Care for their patients. It can also
enhance their time management needs and most importantly improve on Patient Safety outcomes.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am new at programming in general. I have just finished a C# basic course in which we built a
MVC application. I will have to bush up on the techniques  used to build that app. In addition 
I will have to research and learn the basics of Bootstrap and JavaScript or just enough to implement them 
into my C# application.
