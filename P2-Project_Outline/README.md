## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to build an inventory and sales app that will allow companies to check stock, sales report, and manage their customers according to their profile. Companies will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit, and remove clients. They will be able to review all inventory and sales, sales by month, and inventory by category.

I decided to make this project because we dont have this system at my current job. Everything has to be counted multiple times by multiple people. I want to emplement this system to help and build efficiency for my day to day workflow. I feel it can help multiple small business companies struggling with the same manual concept.
